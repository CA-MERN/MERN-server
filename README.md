### Sprint Planning

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

We determined that setting weekly sprints was an ideal format for our project. We created a card in Trello that organised them by date and we were able to form checklists of what we wanted to have completed at the end of each sprint for the front-end and back-end. Whilst working we have a current doing card and then a completed card which we are able to distinguish each feature/component being worked on and what is completed.

In the initial planning stages we planned our Trello for the server/client based off features which would be the names of the branches. Our first feature for server/client was the user and during the first Sprint it was decided Shelby would complete the back-end code and testing and Adrienne would complete the front-end code and testing.  Each morning we begin with our own stand up in which we show what we have worked on, explained our code, listed any challenges and also any wins. Since we are working on back-end and front-end seperate, this ensures we are both know what is happening on each feature. 

Initially we were going to switch front-end and back-end for each feature, but we decided for the MVP product that Shelby would stick to the back-end and Adrienne on the front-end to ensure we delivered a great MVP product on time. This plan tailored to each of our strengths. This being said, once the MVP is completed all our nice to have features that we want to implement, we will switch roles for the implementation of these features. In the planning stage we decided to pair programme when it comes for connecting the server and client, which we are planning on doing at the end of each feature branch. 

Additionally when it comes time to styling we will likely do a mixture of pair programming and allocation of components to style as we both really enjoy styling.

### Sprint 1

USER BRANCH

##### Shelby:

At this start of this Sprint, Shelby set up the initial back-end server code and all the express/mongo/mongoose connections and tested it was all set up correctly. Then the first component worked on was the implementation of passport, passport-JWT and jsonwebtoken for user account and authorisation. The implementation of this involved using the express session to pass around the JWT. Alongside this was the initial user account routes , the setting up of the testing of these API end points was a steep initial learning curve. This began with researching testing frameworks in which Mocha along with super test was chosen. Shelby decided on constructing the tests with a description of each Http request eg. 'GET /ingredients/:username/fridgeâ€™. The get requests were test with expecting a 200 code back along with JSON content, the post/patch requests tested by sending dummy data through the test database and testing the response matching, and the delete requests were tested with a 204 response code. The biggest hurdles during the process were setting up the correct dummy data, the tear down data functions and deciding on the structure of the tests.

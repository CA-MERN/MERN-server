### Sprint Planning

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

We determined that setting weekly sprints was an ideal format for our project. We created a card in Trello that organised them by date and we were able to form checklists of what we wanted to have completed at the end of each sprint for the front-end and back-end. Whilst working we have a current doing card and then a completed card which we are able to distinguish each feature/component being worked on and what is completed.

In the initial planning stages we planned our Trello for the server/client based off features which would be the names of the branches. Our first feature for server/client was the user and during the first Sprint it was decided Shelby would complete the back-end code and testing and Adrienne would complete the front-end code and testing.  Each morning we begin with our own stand up in which we show what we have worked on, explained our code, listed any challenges and also any wins. Since we are working on back-end and front-end seperate, this ensures we are both know what is happening on each feature. 

Initially we were going to switch front-end and back-end for each feature, but we decided for the MVP product that Shelby would stick to the back-end and Adrienne on the front-end to ensure we delivered a great MVP product on time. This plan tailored to each of our strengths. This being said, once the MVP is completed all our nice to have features that we want to implement, we will switch roles for the implementation of these features. In the planning stage we decided to pair programme when it comes for connecting the server and client, which we are planning on doing at the end of each feature branch. 

Additionally when it comes time to styling we will likely do a mixture of pair programming and allocation of components to style as we both really enjoy styling.

USER BRANCH

##### Shelby:

At this start of this Sprint, Shelby set up the initial back-end server code and all the express/mongo/mongoose connections and tested it was all set up correctly. Then the first component worked on was the implementation of passport, passport-JWT and jsonwebtoken for user account and authorisation. The implementation of this involved using the express session to pass around the JWT. Alongside this was the initial user account routes , the setting up of the testing of these API end points was a steep initial learning curve. This began with researching testing frameworks in which Mocha along with super test was chosen. Shelby decided on constructing the tests with a description of each Http request eg. 'GET /ingredients/:username/fridgeâ€™. The get requests were test with expecting a 200 code back along with JSON content, the post/patch requests tested by sending dummy data through the test database and testing the response matching, and the delete requests were tested with a 204 response code. The biggest hurdles during the process were setting up the correct dummy data, the tear down data functions and deciding on the structure of the tests. 

Some issues were the concern of updating the user via account settings page and then the whole data being overridden, however this issue was solved for the moment since the whole user model is being sent to the account settings page, so there for can be returned with the new data. However this solution is ok for the level the project is at now, for future scalabilty this would need to be altered.

#### Sprint 2- 7/12- 13/12

##### Shelby:

FRIDGE/PANTRY BRANCH

During this sprint the CRUD for ingredients was implemented. Shelby managed to keep the codebase dry by not doing Fridge and Pantry CRUD, rather just implementing an Ingredient CRUD base and using conditionals checking the path name, which then determines which part of the user model gets updated. 

USER BRANCH

When implementing s3 and Multer for profile image upload, some blockers were incorrect set up of IAM policy, the use of .single with multer (use .any to ensure the image would upload.)

Shelby also began implementing validation using express-validator starting with validation for the email, password and user information on registering, account settings page and login. 

Started writing passing fail tests to test the end points when errors arise. This pair with using validation I was able to test the results of invalid data being input for the user model. 

Current blockers are implementation of persisting cookies with mocha/supertest testing so tests can be run even with authenticated routes. eg. with the middleware of "passport.authenticate('jwt', {session: false})". Currently all  tests are based with this middleware not being implemented. Code that was tried includes, using superagent, setting headers, setting a beforeAll function of logging in the user and trying to manually set the cookies. The closest to success was using a beforeAll function of logging in the user, however accessing the cookies from that Http request response was not successful. This task will be moved to next sprint. 

CLIENT

Completed the intial styling for the home/nav/login/register to start the basis of styling, to enable easier implementation of the react client-side.

#### Sprint 3- 14/12-27/12

RECIPE BRANCH

Began Work on this feature branch on the server client. Initial routes set up. The biggest challenge was the code required for the process of getting the user data from the DB (being ingredients and preferences), error handling, sanitising the data (functions checking if null, processing booleans into an array then finally a string), then sending the correct data to the Spoonacular API calls. During the code process of the helper functions a lot of manual testing done via the console was done with some dummy data, to ensure that the JS functions were working as intended. Additionally testing Spoonacular API via postman was done to determine with Http request URLs were the right ones to use for this application. 

Through Automatic testing coupled with some manual testing the main utility function for return recipe data for the browse page is:
finding a User in Db per params, builds the query info per the data from user, uses that data to axios request Spoonacular API for recipes based off ingredients, then collect those recipes IDs, sanitize the data, then use the IDS for another API call to get the detailed recipe information. 

In my testing of the main function in which makes all the API calls and data validation, I had some trouble testing with getting the data. I was trying to return it as a variable, then I used await outside the main async function (even though the test function was async). What you was needed was to wrap the await call inside an async function, and then call that async function in the top-level of your script. Immediately outputting the result just returned a promise pendings, then using the given code with another await to return the promise returned undefined. The below is the serious of options:

In my first test call:

````js
const recipes = returnRecipesToBrowse(req);
console.log(recipes); // will give you something like Promise {pending}

````

Then this was tried:

````js
const recipes = await returnRecipesToBrowse(req);; // will error
console.log(recipes); //undefined

````
What was the final result was:

````js
const returnRecipesToBrowse = async (req) => {
   const recipes = await User.findOne({ username: req.user.username })
    .then(recipes =>  userQueryBuilder(recipes))
    .then(queryItems =>  sanitizeDataForIngredientQuery(queryItems))
    .then(recipesObject => recipeIdGetter(recipesObject.data))
    .then(recipeIdsString => detailedRecipeAPISearch(recipeIdsString))
    .then(recipes =>  {return recipes})
    .catch(error => console.log(error) /*res.status(400).json({
      message: 'Request to Spoonacular failed/unauthorized'
   /})*/)
  return recipes
};   
//THIS IS THE LAST FUNCTION BEING CALLED IN THE ASYNC
const detailedRecipeAPISearch = async function (recipeIdsString) { 
  return await request.get(`informationBulk?ids=${recipeIdsString}&apiKey=${process.env.RECIPE_API_KEY}`)
}

returnRecipesToBrowse(req); // run the async function at the top-level, since top-level await is not currently supported in Node

````
I did not need to await on the final returnRecipesToBrowse(req) call, since Node won't exit until its event loop is empty.

When implementing the main code for displaying recipes for browsing, it was discovered that there were certain limitations with using the Spoonacular API. The 'search recipes' which enables a complex search with ingredients and other query parameters like diet and intolerances, proved not useful as it only displays recipes that have all the ingredients in the query not recipes that include one or more of the ingredients. This search was much too specific as we needed to return recipes with one or more of the query ingredients. To supplement the above option, it was decided to use the 'search recipes by ingredients', which will return recipes that include one or more the ingredients in the query, however the returned object is not detailed. Using the object returned above, the recipe ID's were extracted to then use in another query which is ' get recipe information bulk' which returns details recipe information using the recipe ID's as the parameters. The returned object from this query though I believe was limited by the paid tiers of the API. Which meant the preferences list was reduced down to just include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, very healthy, cheap, popular, sustainable, and low-fod-map. In future the payment tier may not opted to increase which would enable more preference options.
